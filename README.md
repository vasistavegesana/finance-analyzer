# Finance Analyzer 📊

A Python-based finance analyzer that reads expense data from a CSV file, cleans the data, analyzes spending patterns, and presents clear insights with visualizations.

This project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into meaningful financial insights using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Finance Analyzer:
- Reads expense data from a CSV file
- Cleans missing or invalid values
- Groups expenses by category
- Calculates total spending
- Identifies highest and lowest spending categories
- Computes remaining monthly income
- Visualizes spending using a bar chart

This project focuses on **data analysis, structure, and clarity**, not just writing code.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- Matplotlib (plot layout and display)
- Seaborn (clean data visualization)
- CSV files
- Virtual Environment (`.venv`)
- Git & GitHub

## 📊 Key Features & Insights

- Total monthly expenses are calculated from real data
- Expenses are grouped and summarized by category
- Highest and lowest spending categories are identified
- Remaining money is calculated using monthly income
- A bar chart visually compares category-wise spending

This allows users to quickly understand where their money is going.

## 📁 Sample Data Format (`expenses.csv`)

```csv
category,amount
rent,2200
food,450
transport,120
entertainment,200
```

The program also handles missing values safely.

If you want, I can:
- Make a **shorter version**
- Make it **more technical**
- Add a **“Future Improvements”** section
- Tailor it for **grading or portfolio**

Just tell me 👍
