📘 Day 11 — Insights + Structure (Notes)

Analysis vs Printing
Analysis = calculating numbers
Printing = showing results to humans

Dictionaries are used to store results together
One function returns many related values

analysis variable
Holds all computed results
Used later for printing and plotting

main() function
Controls the flow of the program
Calls functions in the correct order

Remaining money
income − total_expenses
Shows how much money is left

📘 Day 12 — Visualization + Professional Setup (Notes)

Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib
Seaborn = cleaner charts
Matplotlib = figure size, labels, showing plot

Both are used together
Seaborn for bars
Matplotlib for layout

Virtual environment (.venv)
Libraries must be installed inside it
Otherwise Python cannot find them

main.py
Entry point of the program
Runs the main logic

final_analyzer.py
Contains all data analysis logic

📘 Key Python Concepts (Notes)

Functions return values
Variables are created where functions are called

Dictionaries
Key → value pairs
Used to store analysis results

if __name__ == "__main__"
Runs code only when file is executed directly
Prevents auto-running when imported
