Functions — reusable code blocks that return values

return — sends results back to the main program

CSV rows — each row is a dictionary (row["key"])

Data cleaning — remove spaces and skip bad values

Accumulator pattern — start at 0 and keep adding

Initialization — variables must exist before use

Loops — process data one item at a time

Defensive coding — handle empty or invalid input

Separation of concerns — logic, data, and output are separate

Debugging logic — fixing why code is wrong, not syntax
