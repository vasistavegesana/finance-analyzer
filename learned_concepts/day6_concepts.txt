Pandas Dataframe is basically  == table like data

The command groupby creates groups but doesnt compute unless there is something that is being asked with it

Aggregation means to combine many of the same to one 

Common Aggregation used: 
1. sum() = sums everything together
2. mean() = average of everything
3. count() = counts how many rows
4. max() = whats the maximum value of something
5. min() = whats the minimum value of something
______________________________________________________
GroupBy + Aggregation (Notes Version)
1. clean_df.groupby("category")

Groups rows by category
No calculation yet

2.["amount"]

Selects the amount column from each group

3. .sum()
Adds values in each group
Produces one number per category

That final step (sum) is the aggregation.
Result: grouped data → summarized values
______________________________________________________

Why aggregation changes ordering: 

 1. groupby() alone → keeps original row order
 2. groupby() + sum() → Pandas creates a new summarized result
 3. Pandas sorts group labels alphabetically by default due to groupby()

That’s why rent moved.
