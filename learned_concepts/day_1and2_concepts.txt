Execution Context — file paths are relative to where the program is run

Return vs Print — return passes data, print only displays (None)

Function Contract — inputs in, output out, no side effects

Variable Scope — function variables are local, globals must be passed

Dead Code — unused logic must be removed after refactors

CSV Module — built-in tool for reading structured external data

csv.DictReader — converts CSV rows into dictionaries by column name

Type Casting — file data is text and must be converted before math

Single Source of Truth — expenses come only from the CSV, not code

Data Pipeline Thinking — input → parse → compute → output
